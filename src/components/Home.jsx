<QuoteBox>Hello, there! <br />
  Nice seeing you here! I am Yoana and I am a 21-year-old student originally from Sofia, Bulgaria. I have been living in Eindhoven, the Netherlands for the past three years, where I am currently studying Media Design at Fontys University of Applied Science. My goal is to become a web developer/designer with a focus on UX/UI, which I find 
  an exciting and dynamic field with many opportunities for creating innovative and user-friendly designs.

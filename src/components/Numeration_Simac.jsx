          <SmallInfo Resp> I have a strong passion for organizing my life and daily activities, which is why I aspire to lead and organize 
            people around me by planning and executing successful events. To achieve this, I conducted   <span style={{color:"#F1C3AC"}}>
            literature research on project management methodologies </span> that would best suit our project needs and goals. After careful consideration,
            I determined that Scrum-ban was the ideal approach as it allows for flexibility and adjustments throughout the project,
             particularly when there are no concrete user requirements as in the case of our project.
             To further my knowledge and skills in this area, I completed several Scrum courses for Scrum Master. This experience provided me with valuable 
            insight into the role of a project manager and helped me determine if this is a career path I would like to pursue in the future. <br></br>
            Also, I was scrum master for the second sprint. This was one the most important moments for our project because
            we gather the most valuable information - the one from the users. Because we were relying on their schedule 
            it was really tricky if we could manage to achieve the goal for the sprint. However, we manage to succeed
            the sprint goal. This was because me as scrum master try to be realistic when I was giving the task between 
            each other. Moreover, putting small targets and deadlines helps us to achieve this. The picture represents
            the management in the second sprint. </SmallInfo>

          <SmallInfo Resp> Our team has decided to conduct  <span style={{color:"#F1C3AC"}}>literature research </span>
          on the topic before presenting it to the end stakeholders to be prepared for what is out there. 
          Each team member has been assigned a specific topic, and mine was to <span style={{color:"#F1C3AC"}}>understand the current onboarding process at Simac</span>. 
          To achieve this, I conducted a literature review of the documents provided by Simac. One of the documents was a feedback survey 
          from their employees, while the other outlined the flow and best practices that Simac can implement.
          Based on these documents, I discovered that there are four stages of onboarding, and most employees feel overwhelmed on their 
          first day due to the many tasks they need to complete. Another interesting finding was that many employees do not use SimacWeb.
          However, the company is doing some things right, such as personalizing the onboarding process based on individuals and assigning
         a "buddy" for the first few days. These insights provided our team with valuable information to guide our project. </SmallInfo>
         <SmallInfo Resp> As there are various steps involved in the onboarding process over several months, we created a          <span style={{color:"#F1C3AC"}}>customer journey map </span>
            to visualize it. The map includes a general overview, as well as two more specific maps detailing the first day and 
            first week at work. Since many actions are happening these days, our team decided to create the maps early on. 
            We can make changes later based on the inputs we receive from the interviews. </SmallInfo>

            <br/><br/>
            <SmallInfo Resp> I participated in <span style={{color:"#F1C3AC"}}> expert interviews </span> to gain insights into how Simac and other companies conduct their onboarding.
                 An interesting fact that was confirmed is that employees are not aware of the full capabilities of SimacWeb, 
                 and there are too many Word documents involved in the Simac onboarding process. 
                 Another company we talked to mentioned that they switched their company language from Dutch to English. They emphasized the 
                 importance of everyone feeling like an expert in their role and taking initiative. </SmallInfo>

          <SmallInfo Resp> After the research that we made we decided to go to the real user and understand how their
           onboarding process was as our main target audience is people who are non-Dutch since this our main users,
          but it does not mean that our solution is excluding the Dutch people. In total we conducted 6 <span style={{color:"#F1C3AC"}}>interviews</span> as
          3 external and 3 from Simac. Each of us was supposed to conduct one interview and to be a chairperson of 
          another way. In this way we were doing different roles in one observing the users and what he says and the
          other one is asking the questions that we prepared. After that we were supposed to analyze it.
          </SmallInfo>
          <SmallInfo Resp>Based on the interviews, my task was to create an <span style={{color:"#F1C3AC"}}> empathy map </span>. After that we realize that  
          <span style={{color:"#F1C3AC"}}> affinity map </span> will be more efficient. After it we realized what we need to do. An example, we thought that 
          there is a huge language barrier, but after the interviews NADSCY find out different. That gave us a 
          starting point for our brainstorming sessions. </SmallInfo>

          <SmallInfo Resp>I was participating in <span style={{color:"#F1C3AC"}}>3 brainstorming sessions</span> as they happened in different phases of the project. The first one was at the early stage of the project with the purpose to dive into the context to create the research question. As a method … . The results were that the main problems were cultural differences, mental support, socializing, cultural and language differences.  </SmallInfo>
          <SmallInfo Resp>The second brainstorming session me the rest of the NADSCY used the <span style={{color:"#F1C3AC"}}>Dark-Side method</span> where we need to see the problem for the negative side of the problem. At the end there were different groups of same ideas that we combined and at the end the group voted on the one that we feel that we are the most important for solving the problem.</SmallInfo>  
          <SmallInfo Resp> The third one was after we conducted the interviews, we decided what we are going to develop as topic – socializing and from there each of the members were supposed to create concept. If you want to understand my concept, click on the button.</SmallInfo>

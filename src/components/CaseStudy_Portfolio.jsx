The assignment is to create a portfolio for the first four weeks, which is important for presenting oneself and showcasing capabilities. The main question guiding the portfolio and the semester's goal is about the desired IT professional identity. The Agile methodology was employed for flexibility in the project, while the Design Thinking Method, particularly the CMD approach, allowed for iterations and adjustments. These methods align more with UX/UI practices.

All of the participants feel confident in using the app. People like the idea of creating content because is something different from the other apps for sports as well as the discount part. The thing that we have to change is the navbar to be static and to include more free things. They would share with their friends especially because they can compete with each other. </SmallInfo>

        The Dutch Design Charrette was one week where different schools from all over Europe to work on a project.
        There were in total 9 groups that were divided into 3 projects. My project was given from Handpicked Agencies and
        The Cruyff Foundation. <br/> <br />
        The assignment was about <span style={{color:"#F1C3AC"}}>The Cruyff Foundation</span>. They have in total three different type of playgrounds, 
        but we focused on their Schoolyard 14. There are 14 games, and we were supposed to <span style={{color:"#F1C3AC"}}>create a new game, 
        a fifth one that needs to be innovative and involves some technology. The games need to be reached by any 
        kid which mean and disabled kid (physical problem, poverty, etc.)</span> Research shows that 25% of all children do
         not exercise enough. This is supported by research showing that the school period is the most inactive 
         period of the day.  A negative effect is a decline in motor and social skills.
         In addition, 15.5% of all elementary school children are overweight.
         Our solution was based on Sustainable Development goals. So, if I have to define the project in one sentence,
        it would sound like this:<span style={{color:"#F1C3AC"}}>"How can the integration of synthetic media, mixed reality, artificial intelligence, 
        and/or big data in the design of Schoolplein14 and its surrounding environment effectively encourage children 
        and young people to engage in outdoor play and physical activities?‚Äù</span>
